# sparv-models

This repository stores models used for different Sparv analyses. The models will be downloaded
automatically by the Sparv pipeline when needed.

If you would like to clone this entire repository you will need to install [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) first in order for the model files to be downloaded correctly.

After downloading and installing the Git command line extension you need to set up Git LFS for your user account by running: 

	git lfs install 

You can then go ahead and clone the repository as usual.
